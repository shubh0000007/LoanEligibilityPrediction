# LoanEligibilityPrediction

This GitHub project meticulously explores Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and constructs predictive models for loan eligibility prediction, utilizing various machine learning algorithms. 📊🔍 The dataset, encompassing both training and test datasets, undergoes meticulous preprocessing steps, including handling missing values, encoding categorical variables using LabelEncoder, and scaling numerical features using StandardScaler. Following preprocessing, models such as the Naive Bayes classifier and Decision Tree are trained and evaluated on the preprocessed data. 🛠️🔢 The project provides detailed insights into data distribution, patterns, and feature relationships through EDA, while also offering comprehensive model evaluation metrics and visualizations to compare the effectiveness of different algorithms in predicting loan eligibility. 📈📉 Additionally, the project highlights the removal of inaccuracies to ensure robust model performance. Hosted on GitHub, this project serves as a valuable resource for practitioners and enthusiasts interested in both machine learning techniques and finance, providing access to code, datasets, and documentation for reproducibility and further exploration. 💻📊📈
